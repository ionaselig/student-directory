Student Directory
=================

First project at Makers Academy is to create a list of students on our course, and handle that data.

### Day 1 - directory.rb
First attempt at coding with Nikesh (@nikeshashar). Struggled initally with Github remotes. subl command not responsive. Using a list of students and their hobbies we input them into an array. We try a few different ways of doing this as we progress through the lesson. Interesting talk from Nicola at ThoughtWorks.

### Day 2 - directory2.rb and exercises
Promiscuously paring away after Catharina (@CatharinaLD) and Nikesh, today I'm paired with Jamie (@jamieallen59). We start again, using the best of both our programmes from yesterday. Discover the joys of Ruby Docs and Stack Overflow. We crack on with the exercises that require our array prints students via various filters and elminates typos by defining constraints on possible responses.

### Day 3 - exercises 
Day 3 coding with Charlie (@Egalitea-leaves)! We explore file saving and loading, including going on a slight tangent adding functionality that checks if a file exists before trying to load / save. We add an interactive menu, prompting users to choose what they want to do. We explore saving the data to a csv file. Along the way we constantly refactor our code to make it as neat as possible. We touch on making a version that uses the CSV library to explore both.

### Day 4 - exercises
Day 4 with Pete. Talk from Richard at Just Giving.

### Day 5 - directory 6
Day 4 Largely missed between doctors and graduation. As a result I enjoyed my first programing threesome with Alex (@BobRazowski) and Jenny (@thejennywang). Introduction to TDD - Test Driven Development from Sam and started to refactor the code.

### Day 6 - x
dmissed due to uni graduation


###Day 7 - directory 7
TDD is here to stay, this time with Zoe (@zoebryant). Started from scratch and built up our tests again, who filled me in on checking CSV files with doubles which had been rather skipped over on Day 3. Accidentally overwrote ~/.bash-profile which removed rvm and rspec which held us up considerably but understood the reinstallation and commands in CLI much more by being forced to repeat them. Tried out vim and nano too. Though our rspec is pretty banging the program isn't on par with the spec file and as such we were testing short sightedly. Working on it now to get it back up to scratch.
